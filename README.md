# sql

Hi, this is a SQL portfolio of code that I've written independently. The repository features two SQL projects.
1) The first project analyzes BitCoin and Ethereum prices, market capitalization, and trading volume over the inception of each respective cryptocurrency. The datasets are 'btc-usd-max.csv' and 'eth-usd-max.csv' and the SQL script is 'btc_eth.sql'.
2) The second project analyzes transaction data from a B2B SaaS company selling sales and marketing software to other companies. The dataset is 'SaaS-sales.csv' and the SQL script is 'SaaS-Sales.sql'.

Thank you!
